The videoapi mediaserver. We need a better name for it.

Requires libev, librtmp and libavcodec.(The latter is not actually used yet,
but we link against it anyway.

The makefile will probably have to be modified locally to suit your needs.

$ ./make
$ ./a.out

Connect with your rtmp client of choice. It establishes the cxn but does
little else after media packets start coming in.
