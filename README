The videoapi mediaserver. We need a better name for it.

Requires libev, librtmp, openssl and Ragel.

The makefile will probably have to be modified locally to suit your needs.

$ make
$ ./a.out

Connect with your rtmp client of choice. It establishes the cxn but does
little else after media packets start coming in.

To view the generated dotfile output, you will need Graphviz and a
Postscript viewer of your choice.

$ make dot
$ evince rtmp.ps
